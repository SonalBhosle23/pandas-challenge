Summary analysis 
•	In this assignment, the school and student data has been summarised based on the local government area which gives a macro view of the school’s performance in that area.
•	The school summary provides the analysis for all the 15 schools to get a more granular level information at a school level.
•	The top and bottom performing school analysis is a good indicator of which schools are performing well and will assist parents in decision making.
•	The lists of average maths score and reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school, is also helpful to understand how students are performing and are from which school.
•	The spending ranges per student is very helpful to understand the $spend per student.
•	The school size scores display the students’ numbers of each school.
•	The school type scores display the school type-based scores.


Conclusion
1.	It is evident from the school summary that the students have performed better in maths than in reading.
2.	As per the school type summary, it can be concluded that the independent schools performed better in maths and reading than the Government schools. Also, another point to be noted was that the Government school budgets were higher than the independent school’s budget but the independent school’s performance was better as compared to Government schools.
